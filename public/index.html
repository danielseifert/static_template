    <p>Albion...A world of magic and monsters, wizards and warriors, orcs and elves...</p>
    <p>A world where brave ones known as Heroes go questing, protect the common folk, and fight to overcome darkness.</p>
    <p>Who will you become, and what will you do? Every action has a consequence: fight bravely in the face of overwhelming odds, and you will be loved and respected by the people. Run away, and you will be reviled and mocked by those you fight to save...</p>  
    <h1> Once Upon A Time...</h1>  
    <p>There were brave warriors who walked in the land of Albion. They wielded weapons of great power to defend the defenseless, and took paths of darkness for the sake of others. But now, 
    none remain. At least, only one. You are the last of heroic blood and lineage. The world has devolved into chaos, infested with evil. Will you fight to defend your homeland? You, and you only, are Albion's last hope...</p>
    <p>You will begin a near peniless street orphan, and slowly work your way to being the greatest hero Albion has ever known.</p>
    <h1>Weapons</h1>  
    <p>Every Hero needs some weapons, and fortunately in Albion there are lots of them! <a href="public/equipment.html">Here</a> you will find some of the many kinds you will use...</p>
    <h1>Worlds</h1>
    <p>There are countless worlds to explore in Albion, some hostile, some peaceful. You can find them <a href>here</a>.</p>
